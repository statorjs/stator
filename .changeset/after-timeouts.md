Add `after` state timeouts: a state may declare `after: [{ delay, send }]` to dispatch `send` after `delay` ms in the state (armed on entry, cancelled on exit; `delay` may depend on context). The companion to entry effects — rescues a state whose entry effect never completes. Timers are in-memory and non-durable (a restart drops them); on fire the event is guard-dropped if the state has already moved on.

Entry effects and `after` now also work on app-lifecycle machines, firing on wall-clock with no session (self-revalidating caches, circuit breakers). Also fixes a chained effect being dropped when one effect's completion triggers another.
