Entry effects. A state can now declare an `entry` async effect that the host schedules when the state is *entered* — a fresh start at the initial state, or a value-changing transition; never on hydration. It reuses the transition-effect pipeline (host-scheduled off the session lock, at-most-once, completion re-enters through the normal event path and reaches live pages over SSE), minus the event argument, and its return is type-checked against the machine's event union like a transition effect.

This is the trigger the reactive-load pattern needs: a machine that starts in `loading`, fetches in its entry effect, and moves to `ready`/`error`. A GET that first loads such a machine now persists the entered state (so it isn't re-created and re-fired next request) and schedules the effect off-lock after the response; the common GET with no entry effect stays a lock-free read.
