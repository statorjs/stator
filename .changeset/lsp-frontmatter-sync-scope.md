Language server: frontmatter is now modelled as a synchronous function body in the editor, matching the runtime. The virtual-code emitter hoists imports/types to module scope and places the executable frontmatter inside the render function, so a top-level `await` (or `return`) in a `.stator` frontmatter is flagged as a TypeScript error in-editor instead of being silently accepted. Closes a divergence where the editor typechecked frontmatter at module scope — where top-level `await` is legal — while the runtime wraps it in a sync function.
